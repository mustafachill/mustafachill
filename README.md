A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...

🌌 I program with the power of the light side of the Force and turn my code into stars in the galaxy.

💻 My computer is my Millennium Falcon, and my keyboard spreads my power to the universe. Writing code is my way of protecting the galaxy.

📱 Phones are my playground, and I make Flutter dance with my keyboard. Writing code is my art, and the apps I develop are works of art.
